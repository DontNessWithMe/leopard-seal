Leopard Seal is a malware that has a little fun destroying any linux machine.

DISCLAIMER: DontNessWithMe is not reponsible for any damage caused by Leopard Seal. Leopard Seal is for educational and recreational purposes only.

There are 2 different versions of Leopard Seal. The regular version and the safe version. The regular version deletes all data in the /home directory
and important system folders, while the safe version only deletes shadow, the user validation file. They won't be able to sign in, but their data will
still be intact.

Directions:
Download Leopard Seal.
Go to your downloads folder.
If downloaded from the GitHub website, extract all files from the .zip file.
If downloaded through git clone, go to the folder that it cloned.
Double click on the version you want to run.
Click "Execute in Terminal".
A terminal window should pop up with a window asking you if you want to proceed.
Answer the prompts, then wait.

Troubleshooting:
Q: When I double-click the file, it doesn't run! What do I do?
